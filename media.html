          Tegan Taylor: Hello, welcome to Coronacast, a daily podcast all about
          the coronavirus. I'm health reporter Tegan Taylor. Norman Swan: And
          I'm physician and journalist Dr Norman Swan. It's Thursday, 11 March,
          2021. And Tegan, another anniversary. Tegan Taylor: Yes, on 11 March,
          2020, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak
          a pandemic. The Australian government and actually declared it a
          pandemic a little bit before that. Norman Swan: And Coronacast had
          called it a pandemic even earlier than that. Tegan Taylor: Yes, we had
          been running for a whole week by this stage. I think it was pretty
          clear from weeks earlier that it was going to be a massive deal. But
          one of the things that was really interesting to me was looking back
          on the sorts of questions that we were getting from our audience a
          year ago. Would you like to hear some of them, Norman? Norman Swan:
          Before you do, we should just remind people where the world was at. So
          the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, he was
          saying…they were late to the party, you'd have to say, in the early
          days of the pandemic. So he was worried the number of cases had
          increased 13-fold in two weeks. So the number of cases that were known
          was not millions, it was just starting really. But Italy was really
          under major stress. Within hours of him announcing the pandemic, in
          Italy all shops except food shops and pharmacies closed. A really
          tough lockdown because of the way things were taking off in Italy. So
          essentially the genie was out of the bottle, it had well spread by
          then and was already brewing, often unknown, in places like the United
          States where they thought they were fine but most people who were
          observing knew they weren't at all. Tegan Taylor: We had had a couple
          of cases here in Australia at that time but I don't think we had had
          community transmission at that stage. Norman Swan: It was mostly just
          from overseas. Tegan Taylor: So the questions that we were getting
          from our audience were things like what's the best way to wash your
          hands, should we be using bath soap or liquid soap, is the virus
          passing from person to person out in the community, and things like
          how many intensive care beds do we have in Australia. Norman Swan: And
          a question about gyms, and I think that was the point where…it was
          getting towards the point where I gave up the gym. I can't remember
          exactly the date I did that but it was close. And in those days there
          was a lot of talk about surfaces, cleaning surfaces, what could you
          use to clean surfaces, detergents, should it all be alcohol. Of course
          detergent was the right thing because it killed the virus. Washing
          hands. A lot of obsession about surfaces. And what we know now, after
          a long period of learning, is that while surfaces are important, they
          are not nearly as important as airborne spread. So if we had known
          that then, we would have said, yes, it's important to do all that and
          keep things hygienic but, you know, airborne spread. And the other
          thing that was really dominant in those days was…it was only a year
          ago…was this whole business of droplet spread at near distance. So a
          lot of your questions were about 1.5 metres, two metres, is it safe
          outside and so on, and this whole idea about droplet spread. And we
          were pretty down on masks as well at that point, partly because there
          was a shortage but also because…and it became a dominant argument for
          the rest of the year, is that in fact while droplet spread is indeed
          part of the story, it is only part of the story, and we now know that
          airborne spread and microdroplets, which stay in the air for a long
          period of time, are really a major issue, and that became very, very
          clear as the year went by. And a lot of you were onto it because you
          are saying what happens if I pass somebody when I'm running and I
          catch that cloud in the air really…you had a sense of that before in
          fact the science caught up with that. We now know that outdoors is a
          pretty safe environment, it's indoors that counts. So we've learnt a
          lot and in many ways your questions have been ahead of the game. But
          what we learnt early on is we had to be very careful what we advised
          because it could have changed behaviour in terms of what people did,
          because loose lips sink ships, and I wasn't referring to the cruise
          ships either. Tegan Taylor: I'm not sure how many ships you've sunk
          over the past year, Norman, but we did have 127 Australian cases by 11
          March last year. But one of the things that really stood out to me
          when I looked back over these questions that people were asking was
          how invested people were in wanting to do the right thing and protect
          themselves and those around them, and just how much more
          health-literate people are a year on now after really quite literally
          and breathing a pandemic time over this past year. Like, hand washing
          and soaps and hand sanitisers, it's something we are all kind of
          fluent in now. Norman Swan: Yes, and I think any Coronacast listener
          could answer all those questions because they've come with us on the
          journey and now we're getting much more deep and harder to answer
          questions about vaccines and the nature of the virus and variants.
          Tegan Taylor: It's a phase that we would be dreaming of being in a
          year ago. The idea of having a vaccine within a year, those numbers
          were being tossed around but it really felt like very, very
          optimistic. So when the World Health Organisation declares a pandemic,
          that puts pressure on countries to respond in a certain way. Do they
          ever declare a pandemic as being officially over? Norman Swan: Very
          good question. I think it's a process, a pandemic being over. In the
          case of influenza, they get vaccines on board, so in 2009 they got
          vaccines on board, it started to transition back into seasonal
          influenza. And when COVID-19 will be over, will be beyond a pandemic,
          is when the majority of people around the world are immunised or a
          large percentage of people are immunised around the world, and it
          comes and goes in seasons rather than being so overwhelming it just
          never goes away and you've got wave after wave after wave. Influenza
          does still come in waves but they are waves dictated by seasons and
          the peaks aren't as high. So it's a transition, and I don't think that
          COVID-19 will transition away from being a pandemic for another couple
          of years, simply because we are not well enough immunised. Tegan
          Taylor: Let's talk about immunisations, because we heard yesterday
          that Professor Brendan Murphy is saying one of the biggest challenges
          with the locally produced AstraZeneca vaccines, the ones that are
          being manufactured here in Melbourne, is just getting them into
          bottles. Norman Swan: Yes, so I'm not quite sure exactly what Brendan
          was talking about at that point in terms of whether there was a
          specific issue, but it is a big part of the process. A really major
          part of the process is you've got these huge vats that are brewing up
          the vaccine, so they have genetically engineered the vaccine, they've
          got the virus attached to the genetic information, they've got to grow
          that up from a starter material and then you've got to decant it and
          get it into bottles, and you've got to get into bottles in the right
          dose because they are multidose vials, and you've got to have a supply
          of the vials made of the right glass and it has got to be done in a
          sterile environment, and I understand it's not a fast process, it's
          not like filling milk bottles. Tegan Taylor: I've seen some of our
          listeners saying things like: can't we just make more vaccine? But
          really the manufacturing process is really involved, the safety
          standards are so high. And the CSL labs are going to be making
          something like a million doses a week. You can't just make more
          because there are so many different checks and balances in that supply
          chain, including just supply of glass. Norman Swan: Yes, I think the
          mRNA vaccines are a bit easier to make than the viral vector vaccines.
          Tegan Taylor: But you've still got to have somewhere to make them.
          Norman Swan: You've got to have somewhere to make them and you've got
          to handle it very gently because the mRNA capsules or the packaging,
          if you like, of the mRNA is very delicate, so you've just got to be a
          bit more careful about that. So there are elements in each. There are
          bottlenecks, and enough vials is one of the bottlenecks. Tegan Taylor:
          So at the moment, at the risk of jinxing us, Australia is in a pretty
          good position in terms of very, very low levels of coronavirus
          locally, but there has been a signal in Adelaide wastewater over the
          past few days indicating that maybe there is some virus that could be
          circulating under the radar. What do we know? Norman Swan: Well, all
          we know is by reports and that the authorities there are saying that
          they think it's an accurate result of coronavirus in the Adelaide
          wastewater. They don't think it's from borders, in other words they
          don't think it's from a returned traveller or somebody who works in
          hotel quarantine. It's hard to know where it would come from if it
          wasn't that because really the only source of virus in Australia is
          from overseas. So it has to have come from a returned traveller or
          somebody who was working on the borders. Maybe it has come from
          another state, but it will have come from somebody from overseas and
          we will in our genomic records have a sense of where the virus would
          have come from, a Victorian traveller, a New South Wales traveller.
          Remember, genomics is hard to do sometimes on this because you're not
          getting the whole virus, you're just getting fragments of the virus.
          Some people excrete for a long time and the question is whether or not
          you are seeing people who are long excreters, and some of the new
          variants do seem to excrete for a fair bit of time. So it's a mystery
          but they think it's real. Tegan Taylor: And some more feedback from
          our audience, Kylie has sent in saying: not a question, just a thank
          you. She is a healthcare worker and just moments ago received her
          first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and she says thank you for helping
          me be prepared and informed and so ready for this moment over the past
          12 months. She said she had no qualms or hesitations as she walked
          into the room today. Here's to dose two. Norman Swan: Yes, here's to
          your dose to, well done Kylie. Tegan Taylor: And Thorlene is asking a
          question about what if the vaccines don't work on the new variants?
          Are we facing another year or two of closed borders, caps on entry and
          hotel quarantine while we have another go at a vaccine rollout? Is
          this just a practice run? Norman Swan: It's not a practice run, this
          turns COVID-19 into the common cold. So if the variants do get in,
          it's highly likely that even the new variants will…the vaccines will
          protect us against severe disease, they will be strong enough to do
          that, but there may well be breakthrough. What it means is that quite
          soon we are going to have to have booster shots from vaccines that
          have been designed to oppose the new variants. They are already being
          worked upon. We had John Skerritt from the TGA talking about that a
          couple of weeks ago on Coronacast if you want to look back, and these
          will almost certainly be called multi-valent vaccines, you'll hear
          that word more and more. And a multi-valent vaccine is like an
          influenza vaccine. So an influenza vaccine contains four versions of
          the influenza vaccine in one vaccine and these are called
          multi-valent, meaning several different forms of the same virus, and
          it's likely that we will have cocktails of vaccines which contain
          various proteins, if you like, or genetic information that stimulates
          spikes of the variants. We're going to have to have those boosters and
          we may have to have boosters on boosters to do that. So I think that
          borders opening up is going to be difficult issue, although you
          probably could argue that people who have had the Pfizer and Moderna
          vaccines are safer than those who have the Astra ones to travel. But I
          think the boosters will come along. The other strategy that they are
          talking about here, by the way, is mixing up the doses where you maybe
          get Astra for the first dose and Pfizer for the second dose, Britain
          is looking at that. It may well be that you get a stronger immune
          response if you do that, by mixing the way you are stimulating the
          immune system. We'll just have to see as time goes on. But borders
          opening up is a fraught issue. Tegan Taylor: Anyway, that's all we've
          got time for on Coronacast today. But of course if you've got a
          question, send it in. We are a year in and we're not stopping yet, so
          that's abc.net.au/coronacast, and mention Coronacast so that we can
          find your question or comment. Norman Swan: And we'll see you
          tomorrow. Tegan Taylor: See you then.
